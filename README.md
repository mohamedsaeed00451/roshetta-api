- Brief Project Description:

  My final year project was about an application that provides an easy way for patients to access the appropriate clinic without hassle. It allows them to book appointments, view past medical conditions and prescriptions. It also enables them to request prescription refills from registered pharmacies. For doctors, the application allows them to add their clinics and assistants, as well as prescribe medications and view detailed patient medical histories and prescriptions. All these features are available after the account is verified by submitting the required documents. As for pharmacists, they can register their pharmacies, receive prescription requests, and dispense medications. We are continuously working on further improvements and developments for the future. The project focused on the development of a multi-user registration system, account activation through document verification, email verification system, and login alert messages.

  I conducted requirements analysis, designed the data model, and implemented the backend using PHP API. The project stood out by addressing a societal issue supported by evidence from the National Research Center in the United States and advanced studies in this field.

  I also managed the development process, conducted code reviews, and performed unit testing to ensure the quality and reliability of the project. The project was successfully presented, and I received an [Honor/Excellent] grade.
